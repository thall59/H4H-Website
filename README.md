# H4H-Website
Hammocks for the Homeless website creation with web dev group (Web Development I)

This website was created as a final project with my group in Web Dev I. We worked with an actual client(student group) and applied what they would like for their website. There is not a lot of content as the student group did not know what they truly needed. 

Website is still in progress, need to make it responsive as well as adjust a few elements to make the pages more pleasing to the eye.
